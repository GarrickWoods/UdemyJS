/* The start of my endeavor to make the website "build-theory.com"

This will be an interactive website, free to users where they can build and customize 3D models of
their vehicles, making them exactly the way they've always dreamed.

I intend to start out in the off-road niche with vehicles and parts. The 3 starting models will be 
a 3rd gen Tacoma, a 5th gen 4Runner, and a 4 door Jeep Wrangler. 

Companies will eventually pay and provide 3d models to list their parts on our website. 
They will also be able to pay extra to sponsor their products on the site, or list them first among parts
that the users see in various part categories. 

There will be a basic front page, showing what the site does and maybe highlighting new additions to the site, 
with a link to the "build Theory visualizer" where they can build their own vehicle(s). 

Eventually this site would serve as a resource for vehicle enthusiasts (mostly in the off-road community initially) 
in the form of video tests and reviews of specific parts, written articles, and forums for users to answer others' questions. 

I would hope to eventually expand the site to include many kinds of cars, but that expansion will be based heavily 
demand within the user community.
